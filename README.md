# SEB Code Challenges

## Intro

During your 12 weeks in SEB, your instructors will be helping you learn tons of coding knowledge and skills using a proven approach where each lesson typically includes a mixture of:

- Instructor lecture & demonstration
- Video-led lecture & demonstration
- Instructor/student code alongs
- In-lesson student exercises
- Lab time

However, true learning doesn't take place until students practice what they've been taught. In fact, it's not uncommon for students to take 7 to 10 days of applying a particular concept before they are truly "comfortable" with it.

To provide practice in class, many lessons are followed with post-lesson labs. And of course, there's project week, where students often feel they learn the most.

To provide additional practice writing JavaScript functions to solve a specific task, you will be encouraged to work on these challenges over time.

## Instructions 

- Create your own repo in your personal GitHub with a challenges.js file and copy the code from the challenges.js file here to your file.

- Solve the challenges by writing functions in the `challenges.js` file.

- Each code challenge requires writing a **single function** to solve.

- After solving a challenge, be sure to check the solution(s) contained in `solutions.js`. If multiple solutions are provided, they are typically shown in increasing order of "elegance".

## Committing and Pushing your Work

- Your instructors will be checking your progress from time-to-time. As you solve the challenges, commit your work, and `$ git push origin main`. This pushes the updates to your repo.
